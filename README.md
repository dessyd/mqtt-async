# MQTT Async code

Pushes IOT measurements published on **MQTT** to Splunk metrics index through **HTTP Event Collector** or **HEC**.

## Publish to MQTT

The IoT device sends its measurements to MQTT topics having the following structure

- `RootTopic`/`thingId`/`sensorId`/`metricName`

As an example, a board having a MAC address of 00:25:96:FF:FE:12:34:56 fitted with a temperature sensor on port 3 might publish a temperature of 21.3 Â°C to a topic having the following name:

- `Things/board-002596FFFE123456/dht11-3/air.temperature`

The payload of this topic will be the actual temperature in floating notation: 21.3

The same sensor will publish the humidity to:

- `Things/board-002596FFFE123456/dht11-3/air.humidity`

And the finally the pressure will be published here:

- `Things/board-002596FFFE123456/dht11-3/air.pressure`

## Read in Splunk

Splunk will receive a `metric` having its value read from the payload, its `metricName`  will be the last subtopic name in the hierarchy, and an extra dimension containing the full topic hierarchy.

### Example

If the MQTT topic `Things/board-002596FFFE123456/dht11-3/air.humidity` has a payload of `45.3` Splunk will receive a metric named `air.humidity` with a value of `45.3` and a dimension named `Topic` with a value of `Things/board-002596FFFE123456/dht11-3/air.humidity`

## Configuration file

There is a single file named `mqtt.conf`that holds all configurations. A template file `mqtt.conf.spec`has details of the configurations stanzas and keys.

## Local Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
# Select Interpreter in VS Code
# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate
python -` python3 -` /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.12/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3.9
# make sure pip is up to date
pip install --upgrade pip
# install project's requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
